CLIENT WANTS AND NEEDS: 

Lindsey Gibson - a personal trainer, fitness instructor and pilates teacher.
Based in an imaginary UK town called Torpoint. She works for a small local gym. 

She wants a modern, light, energetic looking website that highlights her skills, her classes, a contact form to get in touch with 
her and her contact information, links to her social media (facebook, twitter and instagram), and pictures that show exercise is 
fun. 

Her favourite colour is yellow and she wants this to be the accent colour of the website.

Preference for a single page to keep things simple.

HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS:

* Single page with scrollspy and fixed navbar.
* Jumbotron with catching text, image background and video link.
* About, Classes and Contact sections.
* Footer with social media icons. 
* Image gallery. 
* Yellow accent colour.
* Smooth transitions.
* Light theme. 
* A few subtle animations for the fun and energetic feel.
